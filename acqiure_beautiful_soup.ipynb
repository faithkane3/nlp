    "\n",
    "#### **<font color=red>What is Beautiful Soup?</font>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is a Pyhon library for scraping information from web pages. You have to be careful when web scraping data from sites that the site allows the practice. You can check by typing `/robots.txt` after the base url of a site. Using the `headers` parameter in your request is also a part of web scraping best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the docs for BeautifulSoup [here](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I also found it very useful to code along with some articles and tutorials I found online to get a feel for scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple but useful web scraping with Beautiful Soup [article](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/web-scraping-with-beautiful-soup).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataquest [tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-beautifulsoup/) from curriculum and intro Dataquest [tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **<font color=orange>So What Do I Do With Beautiful Soup?</font>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are looking to retrieve content from a web page, but the web page is written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), so we will use the `requests` library to get a response with the HTML from our desired page and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML response. As you begin scraping, it would be helpful to have a basic understanding of the different HTML elements used to create web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### HTML Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "An HTML element usually consists of a start tag `<html>` and an end tag `</html>` with content between the tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<html>` element defines the whole document.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<body>` element defines the document body.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<h1>` element defines a heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<p>` or paragraph element defines new pargraphs of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<a>` element (tell the browser to render a link). `<a>` elements use the `href` attribute to tell the link where to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<div>` element defines a division or area, like a container, of the web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<img>` element defines an image and uses the `src` attribute to hold the image address.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### HTML Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "These are optional, but they make the HTML elements easier to work with because they give the elements names. You will have to examine a web page to find out if it uses these properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "`class` is an attribute of an HTML element that defines equal styles for tags with the same class. One element can have multiple classes and different elements can share the same classes, so classes cannot be used as unique identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "`id` is an attribute of an HTML element. Each element can only have one id, so they can be used as unique identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "`itemprop` is an attribute that consists of a name-value pair and is used to add properties to an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "`href` is an attribute of an `<a>` element that contains the link address.\n",
    "\n",
    "`src` is an attribuate of an `<img>` element that contains the address for an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **<font color=green>Now What?</font>**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need to use the `requests` library to retrieve the HTML from a web page we want to scrape. You can review how to use the `requests` library in my notebook [here](https://faithkane3.github.io/time_series_review/time_series_review).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will inspect the structure of the web page by right-clicking on the page we want to scrape and clicking `inspect`. By clicking the icon in the far upper left of the new window, we can move our cursor over the part of the web page we want to scrape and see the responsible HTML code for that section high-lighted on the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use HTML tags, CSS class (`class_=''`), Regex patterns, CSS selectors, and more with `BeautifulSoup` search methods like `soup.find(name, attrs)`, `soup.find_all(name, attrs)`, `soup.select(selector)`, `soup.select_one(selector)`, and more.\n",
