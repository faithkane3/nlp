In other words, you can manipulate natural language in such a way that renders it useful in machine learning. Machines can't read words, but they can recognize numbers, so we have to process the text we want to use in a way that retains the original meaning while representing the text with numbers."

It can make it easier when you are searching for a particular word in your text to search for their common stem rather than every form of the word. Stemmers aren't that sophisticated in the way they chop off word endings at their common stems; Spacy, another python NLP library, doesn't even include a stemmer in their library. Spacy only offers the more sophisticated lemmatizer, which we will look at in NLTK next."

    "#### Lemmatize Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemmatization** - is when you reduce related words in your text to their lemma or word base by applying a morphological analysis to your text. Like stemming, this is done to reduce the number of forms you have of the same word, so they can be analyzed as a single item. However, with stemming, you might end up with tokens that are not actually words anymore after they have been chopped off at their base, but with lemmatization you will end up with real words. A drawback of lemmatization is that it takes longer than stemming; you can try both to see which gives you better results as you analyze a given text."
